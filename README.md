#POS with NetworkX in articles 
#ŸêAlaa Ahmed Elshafei



#Introduction:
The code demonstrates how to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to perform Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging on an Arabic text dataset. The script uses several NLP libraries such as NLTK, FarasaSegmenter, and NetworkX to tokenize the text, remove stopwords, tag the text with POS tags, and visualize the resulting network graph.
 

#Data description:
The code reads an Arabic  articles dataset from a file named "arabic_dataset.txt" and preprocesses it using tokenization, stopword removal, and POS tagging. The resulting dataset is a list of POS tags for each word in the input text.


#Baseline experiments:
The goal of the baseline experiment is to perform POS tagging on the input text and visualize the resulting network graph. The script achieves this goal by using FarasaSegmenter to tag the text with POS tags and NetworkX to create a network graph of the resulting POS tags.

 
#Tools and external resources:
###The code uses several Python libraries for NLP tasks such as:

* NLTK for tokenization and stopword removal
* FarasaSegmenter for POS tagging
* NetworkX for creating a network graph of the POS tags
* matplotlib for visualizing the network graph
* The code also uses an external dataset named "arabic_dataset.txt" 
* that contains the Arabic text to be processed.
 
 
#Conclusion:
The code snippet demonstrates how to use NLP tools to perform POS tagging on Arabic text and visualize the resulting network graph. The resulting graph can be useful in analyzing the syntactic structure of the input text. The script can be extended to perform other NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis.

#Answers to questions:

The biggest challenge in this project might be dealing with the complexity of the Arabic language and the lack of readily available datasets and tools for Arabic NLP tasks.
From this project, one can learn how to use various Python libraries for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and POS tagging. The project also demonstrates how to visualize the resulting data using NetworkX and matplotlib.
